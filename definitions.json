Pie charts are implemented in the Wolfram Language as PieChart[data].",
  "15 Puzzle": "The \"15 puzzle\" is a sliding square puzzle commonly (but incorrectly) attributed to Sam Loyd. However, research by Slocum and Sonneveld has revealed that Sam Loyd did not invent the 15 puzzle and had nothing to do with promoting or popularizing it. The puzzle craze that was created by the 15 puzzle began in January 1880 in the United States and in April in Europe and ended by July 1880. Loyd first claimed in 1891 that he invented the puzzle, and he continued until his death a 20 year campaign to falsely take credit for the puzzle. The actual inventor was Noyes Chapman, the Postmaster of Canastota, New York, and he applied for a patent in March 1880.",
  "Geometric Problems of Antiquity": "The Greek problems of antiquity were a set of geometric problems whose solution was sought using only compass and straightedge: \n1. circle squaring. \n2. cube duplication. \n3. angle trisection. \nOnly in modern times, more than 2000 years after they were formulated, were all three ancient problems proved insoluble using only compass and straightedge.",

A real quadratic algebraic integer greater than 1 and of degree 2 or 3 is a Pisot number if its norm is equal to \u00b1 1. The golden ratio \u03d5 (denoted \u03b8_0 when considered as a Pisot number) is an example of a Pisot number since it has degree two and norm -1.",

It has 57 vertices, 171 edges, 171 faces, and 57 cells. It cannot be represented in 3-dimensional space in any reasonable way and is highly self-intersecting even in 4-dimensional space because its boundary cells are single-sided manifolds such as a M\u00f6bius strip or Klein bottle.

  "Fonten\u00e9 Theorems": "There are three theorems related to pedal circles that go under the collective title of the Fonten\u00e9 theorems.\nThe first Fonten\u00e9 theorem lets \u0394ABC be a triangle and P an arbitrary point, \u0394A' B' C' be the medial triangle of \u0394ABC, and \u0394XYZ be the pedal triangle of \u0394ABC with respect to P. Denote the intersections of the corresponding sides of \u0394A' B' C' and \u0394XYZ as D, E, and F (e.g., D is the intersection of B' C' and YZ, etc.), then the lines XD, YE and ZF meet at a point L common to the circumcircles of \u0394A' B' C' (which is the nine-point circle of \u0394ABC) and \u0394XYZ (which is the pedal circle of \u0394ABC with respect to P).",
  "Additive Cellular Automaton": "An additive cellular automaton is a cellular automaton whose rule is compatible with an addition of states. Typically, this addition is derived from modular arithmetic. Additive rules allow the evolution for different initial conditions to be computed independently, then the results combined by simply adding. The results for arbitrary starting conditions can therefore be computed very efficiently by convolving the evolution of a single cell with an appropriate convolution kernel (which, in the case of two-color automata, would correspond to the set of initially \"active\" cells).",
  "Fundamental Group": "The fundamental group of an arcwise-connected set X is the group formed by the sets of equivalence classes of the set of all loops, i.e., paths with initial and final points at a given basepoint p, under the equivalence relation of homotopy. The identity element of this group is the set of all paths homotopic to the degenerate path consisting of the point p. The fundamental groups of homeomorphic spaces are isomorphic. In fact, the fundamental group only depends on the homotopy type of X. The fundamental group of a topological space was introduced by Poincar\u00e9.",
  "Root of Unity": "The nth roots of unity are roots e^(2\u03c0ik/n) of the cyclotomic equation\nx^n = 1, which are known as the de Moivre numbers. The notations \u03b6_k, \u03f5_k, and \u03b5_k, where the value of n is understood by context, are variously used to denote the kth nth root of unity.\n+1 is always an nth root of unity, but -1 is such a root only if n is even. In general, the roots of unity form a regular polygon with n sides, and each vertex lies on the unit circle.",
  "Game of Life": "The game of life is the best-known two-dimensional cellular automaton, invented by John H. Conway and popularized in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column starting in October 1970. The game of life was originally played (i.e., successive generations were produced) by hand with counters, but implementation on a computer greatly increased the ease of exploring patterns.",

  "Aristotle's Wheel Paradox": "A paradox mentioned in the Greek work Mechanica, dubiously attributed to Aristotle. Consider the above diagram depicting a wheel consisting of two concentric circles of different diameters (a wheel within a wheel). There is a 1:1 correspondence of points on the large circle with points on the small circle, so the wheel should travel the same distance regardless of whether it is rolled from left to right on the top straight line or on the bottom one. this seems to imply that the two circumferences of different sized circles are equal, which is impossible.",
  "Holonomy Group": "On a Riemannian manifold M, tangent vectors can be moved along a path by parallel transport, which preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. So a closed loop at a base point p, gives rise to a invertible linear map of TM_p, the tangent vectors at p. It is possible to compose closed loops by following one after the other, and to invert them by going backwards. Hence, the set of linear transformations arising from parallel transport along closed loops is a group, called the holonomy group.",

  "Homothetic Center": "The meeting point of lines that connect corresponding points from homothetic figures. In the above figure, O is the homothetic center of the homothetic figures ABCDE and A' B' C' D' E'. For figures which are similar but do not have parallel sides, a similitude center exists.\nGiven two nonconcentric circles, draw radii parallel and in the same direction. Then the line joining the extremities of the radii passes through a fixed point on the line of centers which divides that line externally in the ratio of radii. This point is called the external homothetic center, or external center of similitude (Johnson 1929, pp. 19-20 and 41).",
  "Bump Function": "Given any open set U in R^n with compact closure K = U^_, there exist smooth functions which are identically one on U and vanish arbitrarily close to U.

  "Homotopic": "Two mathematical objects are said to be homotopic if one can be continuously deformed into the other. For example, the real line is homotopic to a single point, as is any tree. However, the circle is not contractible, but is homotopic to a solid torus. The basic version of homotopy is between maps. Two maps f_0 :X->Y and f_1 :X->Y are homotopic if there is a continuous map\nF:X\u00d7[0, 1]->Y\nsuch that F(x, 0) = f_0(x) and F(x, 1) = f_1(x).",
  "Cayley Graph": "Let G be a group, and let S\u2286G be a set of group elements such that the identity element I not element S. The Cayley graph associated with (G, S) is then defined as the directed graph having one vertex associated with each group element and directed edges (g, h) whenever gh^(-1) element S. The Cayley graph may depend on the choice of a generating set, and is connected iff S generates G (i.e., the set S are group generators of G).",
  "Kiepert Parabola": "Let three similar isosceles triangles \u0394A' BC, \u0394AB' C, and \u0394ABC' be constructed on the sides of a triangle \u0394ABC. Then \u0394ABC and \u0394A' B' C' are perspective triangles, and the envelope of their perspectrix as the vertex angle of the erected triangles is varied is a parabola known as the Kiepert parabola. It has trilinear conic function\nx:y:z = a(b^2 - c^2):b(c^2 - a^2):c(a^2 - b^2).\nThis parabola was first studied by Artzt.",
  "Simson Line": "The Simson line is the line containing the feet P_1, P_2, and P_3 of the perpendiculars from an arbitrary point P on the circumcircle of a triangle to the sides or their extensions of the triangle. This line was attributed to Simson by Poncelet, but is now frequently known as the Wallace-Simson line since it does not actually appear in any work of Simson (Johnson 1929, p. 137, p. 41; de Guzm\u00e1n 1999). The inverse statement to that given above, namely that the locus of all points P in the plane of a triangle \u0394ABC such that the feet of perpendiculars from the three sides of the triangle is collinear is given by the circumcircle of \u0394ABC, is sometimes called the Wallace-Simson theorem (de Guzm\u00e1n 1999).",
  "Chart Tangent Space": "From the point of view of coordinate charts, the notion of tangent space is quite simple. The tangent space consists of all directions, or velocities, a particle can take. In an open set U in R^n there are no constraints, so the tangent space at a point p is another copy of R^n. The set U could be a coordinate chart for an n-dimensional manifold.",

  "Six Circles Theorem": "Starting with a triangle, draw a circle touching two sides. Then draw a circle tangent to this circle and two other sides. Continue in the same direction. The result is a chain of circles in which the sixth circle is tangent to the first.",
  "Circle Bundle": "A circle bundle \u03c0:E->M is a fiber bundle whose fibers \u03c0^(-1)(x) are circles. It may also have the structure of a principal bundle if there is an action of SO(2) that preserves the fibers, and is locally trivial. That is, if every point has a trivialization U\u00d7S^1 such that the action of SO(2) on S^1 is the usual one.",
  "Spiral Similarity": "The combination of a central dilation and a rotation about the same center. However, the combination of a central dilation and a rotation whose centers are distinct is also a spiral symmetry. In fact, any two directly similar figures are related either by a translation or by a spiral symmetry.\nA spiral similarity tessellation of any ordinary tessellation can be constructed by placing a series of polygonal tiles of decreasing size on an equilateral spiral.",
  "Spiric Section": "The equation of the curve of intersection of a torus with a plane perpendicular to both the midplane of the torus and to the plane x = 0.

Let the tube of a torus have radius a, let its midplane lie in the z = 0 plane, and let the center of the tube lie at a distance c from the origin. Now cut the torus with the plane y = r. The equation of the torus with y = r gives the equation\n(c - sqrt(x^2 + r^2))^2 + z^2 = a^2\nc^2 - a^2 + x^2 + z^2 + r^2 = 2csqrt(x^2 + r^2)",
  "Circle Line Picking": "Given a unit circle, pick two points at random on its circumference, forming a chord. Without loss of generality, the first point can be taken as (1, 0), and the second by (cos\u03b8, sin\u03b8), with \u03b8 element [0, \u03c0] (by symmetry, the range can be limited to \u03c0 instead of 2\u03c0). The distance s between the two points is then\ns(\u03b8) = sqrt(2 - 2cos\u03b8) = 2 left bracketing bar sin(1/2 \u03b8) right bracketing bar .\nThe average distance is then given by\ns^_ = ( integral_0^\u03c0 s(\u03b8) d\u03b8)/( integral_0^\u03c0 d\u03b8) = 4/\u03c0.",

  "C^k Function": "A function with k continuous derivatives is called a C^k function. In order to specify a C^k function on a domain X, the notation C^k(X) is used. The most common C^k space is C^0, the space of continuous functions, whereas C^1 is the space of continuously differentiable functions. Cartan writes humorously that \"by 'differentiable, ' we mean of class C^k, with k being as large as necessary.\"\nOf course, any smooth function is C^k, and when l>k, then any C^l function is C^k. It is natural to think of a C^k function as being a little bit rough, but the graph of a C^3 function \"looks\" smooth.",
  "Steiner Chain": "Given two circles with one interior to the other, if small tangent circles can be inscribed around the region between the two circles such that the final circle is tangent to the first, the circles form a Steiner chain.\nThe simplest way to construct a Steiner chain is to perform an inversion on a symmetrical arrangement on n circles packed between a central circle of radius b and an outer concentric circle of radius a.",
  "Clean Tile Problem": "Clean tile is a game investigated by Buffon in which players bet on the number of different tiles a thrown coin will partially cover on a floor that is regularly tiled. Buffon investigated the probabilities on a triangular grid, square grid, hexagonal grid, and grid composed of rhombi. Assume that the side length of the tile l is greater than the coin diameter d. Then, on a square grid, it is possible for a coin to land so that it partially covers 1, 2, 3, or 4 tiles. On a triangular grid, it can land on 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 tiles. On a hexagonal grid, it can land on 1, 2, or 3 tiles.\nSpecial cases of this game give the Buffon-Laplace needle problem (for a square grid) and Buffon's needle problem (for infinite equally spaced parallel lines).",
  "Stomachion": "The stomachion is a 14-piece dissection puzzle similar to tangrams. It is described in fragmentary manuscripts attributed to Archimedes as noted by Magnus Ausonius (310-395 A.D.). The puzzle is also referred to as the \"loculus of Archimedes\" (Archimedes' box) or \"syntemachion\" in Latin texts. The word stomachion has as its root the Greek word \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1^' \u03c7\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, meaning \"stomach.\" Note that Ausonius refers to the figure as the \"ostomachion, \" an apparent corruption of the original Greek.",
  "Coin Paradox": "After a half rotation of the coin on the left around the central coin (of the same radius), the coin undergoes a complete rotation. In other words, a coin makes two complete rotations when rolled around the boundary of an identical coin.

Each player uses pieces of a particular color (commonly black and red, or sometimes yellow and red), and the object is to be the first to obtain four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6 pieces, it is full and no other piece can be placed in the column.",
  "Neuberg Circles": "The Neuberg A_1-circle is the locus of the polygon vertex A_1 of a triangle on a given base A_2 A_3 and with a given Brocard angle \u03c9.

If two submanifolds do not intersect, then they are automatically transversal. For example, two curves in R^3 are transversal only if they do not intersect at all.

  "Deck Transformation": "Deck transformations, also called covering transformations, are defined for any cover p:A->X. They act on A by homeomorphisms which preserve the projection p. Deck transformations can be defined by lifting paths from a space X to its universal cover X^~, which is a simply connected space and is a cover of \u03c0:X^~ ->X. Every loop in X, say a function f on the unit interval with f(0) = f(1) = p, lifts to a path f^~ element X^~, which only depends on the choice of f^~ element \u03c0^(-1)(p), i.e., the starting point in the preimage of p. Moreover, the endpoint f^~(1) depends only on the homotopy class of f and f^~(0). Given a point q element X^~, and \u03b1, a member of the fundamental group of X, a point \u03b1\u00b7q is defined to be the endpoint of a lift of a path f which represents \u03b1.\nThe deck transformations of a universal cover X^~ form a group \u0393, which is the fundamental group of the quotient space\nX = X^~/\u0393.\nFor example, when X is the square torus then X^~ is the plane and the preimage \u03c0^(-1)(p) is a translation of the integer lattice {(n, m)} subset R^2. Any loop in the torus lifts to a path in the plane, with the endpoints lying in the integer lattice. These translated integer lattices are the group orbits of the action of Z\u00d7Z on R^2 by addition. The above animation shows the action of some deck transformations on some disks in the plane. The spaces are the torus and its universal cover, the plane. An element of the fundamental group, shown as the path in blue, defines a deck transformation of the universal cover. It moves around the points in the universal cover. The points moved to have the same projection in the torus. The blue path is a loop in the torus, and all of its preimages are shown.",

  "Alexander Polynomial": "The Alexander polynomial is a knot invariant discovered in 1923 by J. W. Alexander. The Alexander polynomial remained the only known knot polynomial until the Jones polynomial was discovered in 1984. Unlike the Alexander polynomial, the more powerful Jones polynomial does, in most cases, distinguish handedness.\nIn technical language, the Alexander polynomial arises from the homology of the infinitely cyclic cover of a knot complement. Any generator of a principal Alexander ideal is called an Alexander polynomial. Because the Alexander invariant of a tame knot in S^3 has a square presentation matrix, its Alexander ideal is principal and it has an Alexander polynomial denoted \u0394(t).",

  "Alexander's Horned Sphere": "The above topological structure, composed of a countable union of compact sets, is called Alexander's horned sphere. It is homeomorphic with the ball B^3, and its boundary is therefore a sphere. It is therefore an example of a wild embedding in E^3. The outer complement of the solid is not simply connected, and its fundamental group is not finitely generated. Furthermore, the set of nonlocally flat (\"bad\") points of Alexander's horned sphere is a Cantor set.\nThe horned sphere as originally drawn by Alexander is illustrated above.",
  "Gompertz Curve": "The function defined by\ny = ab^(q^x) .\nIt is used in actuarial science for specifying a simplified mortality law. Using s(x) as the probability that a newborn will achieve age x, the Gompertz law is\ns(x) = exp[-m(c^x - 1)], for c>1, x>=0.",
  "Poisson Process": "A Poisson process is a process satisfying the following properties: \n1. The numbers of changes in nonoverlapping intervals are independent for all intervals. \n2. The probability of exactly one change in a sufficiently small interval h congruent 1/n is P = \u03bdh congruent \u03bd/n, where \u03bd is the probability of one change and n is the number of trials. \n3. The probability of two or more changes in a sufficiently small interval h is essentially 0.",
  "Goodstein Sequence": "Given a hereditary representation of a number n in base b, let B[b](n) be the nonnegative integer which results if we syntactically replace each b by b + 1 (i.e., B[b] is a base change operator that 'bumps the base' from b up to b + 1). The hereditary representation of 266 in base 2 is\n266 | = | 2^8 + 2^3 + 2\n | = | 2^(2^(2 + 1)) + 2^(2 + 1) + 2, so bumping the base from 2 to 3 yields\nB[2](266) = 3^(3^(3 + 1)) + 3^(3 + 1) + 3.",
  "Poisson's Equation": "A second-order partial differential equation arising in physics, del ^2 \u03c8 = - 4\u03c0\u03c1.\nIf \u03c1 = 0, it reduces to Laplace's equation.\nIt is also related to the Helmholtz differential equation\n del ^2 \u03c8 + k^2 \u03c8 = 0.",
  "Goodstein's Theorem": "For all n, there exists a k such that the kth term of the Goodstein sequence G_k(n) = 0. In other words, every Goodstein sequence converges to 0.\nThe secret underlying Goodstein's theorem is that the hereditary representation of n in base b mimics an ordinal notation for ordinals less than some number. For such ordinals, the base bumping operation leaves the ordinal fixed whereas the subtraction of one decreases the ordinal. But these ordinals are well ordered, and this allows us to conclude that a Goodstein sequence eventually converges to zero.",
  "Poker": "Poker is a card game played with a normal deck of 52 cards. Sometimes, additional cards called \"jokers\" are also used. In straight or draw poker, each player is normally dealt a hand of five cards. Depending on the variant, players then discard and redraw cards, trying to improve their hands. Bets are placed at each discard step. The number of possible distinct five-card hands is equal to the number of possible ways of picking five cards out of a deck of 52, namely\nN = (52\n5) = 2598960, where (n\nk) is a binomial coefficient.",

An algebraic integer is a special case of an algebraic number (for which the leading coefficient a_n need not equal 1). Radical integers are a subring of the algebraic integers.",
  "Polar Angle": "There are two different definitions of the polar angle.\nIn the plane, the polar angle \u03b8 is the counterclockwise angle from the x-axis at which a point in the xy-plane lies.\nIn spherical coordinates, the polar angle is the angle measured from the z-axis, denoted \u03d5 in this work, and also variously known as the zenith angle and colatitude.",
  "Aliasing": "Given a power spectrum (a plot of power vs. frequency), aliasing is a false translation of power falling in some frequency range (-f_c, f_c) outside the range. Aliasing is caused by discrete sampling below the Nyquist frequency. It can be minimized by either increasing the underlying sampling rate or (if that is not practical or possible) pre-filtering the signal to suppress high-frequency components.",
  "Aliquot Sequence": "Let\ns(n) congruent \u03c3(n) - n, where \u03c3(n) is the divisor function and s(n) is the restricted divisor function. Then the sequence of numbers\ns^0(n) congruent n, s^1(n) = s(n), s^2(n) = s(s(n)), ...\nis called an aliquot sequence. If the sequence for a given n is bounded, it either ends at s(1) = 0 or becomes periodic.",

  "Gram-Schmidt Orthonormalization": "Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization, also called the Gram-Schmidt process, is a procedure which takes a nonorthogonal set of linearly independent functions and constructs an orthogonal basis over an arbitrary interval with respect to an arbitrary weighting function w(x).\nApplying the Gram-Schmidt process to the functions 1, x, x^2, ... on the interval [-1, 1] with the usual L^2 inner product gives the Legendre polynomials (up to constant multiples, p. 47).",
  "Polar Vector": "There are two different definitions of \"polar vector.\"\nIn elementary math, the term \"polar vector\" is used to refer to a representation of a vector as a vector magnitude (length) and angle, which is equivalent to specifying its endpoints in polar coordinates (illustrated above).\nIn physics, a polar vector is a vector such as the radius vector r that reverses sign when the coordinate axes are reversed. Polar vectors are the type of vector usually simply known as \"vectors.\" In contrast, pseudovectors (also called axial vectors) do not reverse sign when the coordinate axes are reversed. Examples of polar vectors include r, the velocity vector v, momentum p, and force F. The cross product of two polar vectors is a pseudovector.",
  "Polar Zonohedron": "A polar zonohedron is a convex zonohedron derived from the star which joins opposite vertices of any right n-gonal prism (for n even) or antiprism (for n odd). The faces of this zonohedron consist of n equal rhombs surrounding one vertex, n rhombs beyond these, and so on, giving n - 1 sets of n rhombs altogether that end with those surrounding the opposite vertex.\nThe following table summarizes the first few polar zonohedra.",

  "Graph Automorphism": "An automorphism of a graph is a graph isomorphism with itself, i.e., a mapping from the vertices of the given graph G back to vertices of G such that the resulting graph is isomorphic with G. The set of automorphisms defines a permutation group known as the graph's automorphism group. For every group \u0393, there exists a graph whose automorphism group is isomorphic to \u0393. The automorphism groups of a graph characterize its symmetries, and are therefore very useful in determining certain of its properties.",
  "Graph Bridge": "A bridge of a connected graph is a graph edge whose removal disconnects the graph. More generally, a bridge is an edge of a not-necessarily-connected graph G whose removal increases the number of components of G. An edge of a connected graph is a bridge iff it does not lie on any cycle.\nA bridge is also known as an isthmus, cut-edge, or cut arc.\nEvery edge of a tree is a bridge. A connected cubic graph contains a bridge iff it contains an articulation vertex, i.e., if it is not a biconnected graph.\nA graph containing one or more bridges is said to be a bridged graph, while a graph containing no bridges is called a bridgeless graph.",
  "Ambient Isotopy": "An ambient isotopy from an embedding of a manifold M in N to another is a homotopy of self diffeomorphisms (or isomorphisms, or piecewise-linear transformations, etc.) of N, starting at the identity map, such that the \"last\" diffeomorphism compounded with the first embedding of M is the second embedding of M. In other words, an ambient isotopy is like an isotopy except that instead of distorting the embedding, the whole ambient space is being stretched and distorted and the embedding is just \"coming along for the ride.\" For smooth manifolds, a map is isotopic iff it is ambiently isotopic.",
  "Graph Complement": "The complement of a graph G, sometimes called the edge-complement, is the graph G', sometimes denoted G^_ or G^c (e.g., Clark and Entringer 1983), with the same vertex set but whose edge set consists of the edges not present in G (i.e., the complement of the edge set of G with respect to all possible edges on the vertex set of G). The graph sum G + G' on a n-node graph G is therefore the complete graph K_n, as illustrated above.\nA graph complement can be computed in the Wolfram Language by the command GraphComplement[g].",
  "Amicable Pair": "An amicable pair (m, n) consists of two integers m, n for which the sum of proper divisors (the divisors excluding the number itself) of one number equals the other. Amicable pairs are occasionally called friendly pairs, although this nomenclature is to be discouraged since the numbers more commonly known as friendly pairs are defined by a different, albeit related, criterion. Symbolically, amicable pairs satisfy\ns(m) | = | n\ns(n) | = | m, where\ns(n) congruent \u03c3(n) - n",
  "Graph Crossing Number": "Given a \"good\" graph G (i.e., one for which all intersecting graph edges intersect in a single point and arise from four distinct graph vertices), the crossing number is the minimum possible number of crossings with which the graph can be drawn, including using curved (non-rectilinear) edges. Several notational conventions exist in the literature, with some of the more common being cr(G) (e.g., Pan and Richter 2007; Clancy et al. 2019), CR(G), cr_0(G) (e.g., Pach and T\u00f3th 2005), and \u03bd(G).",

In other words, a graph's diameter is the largest number of vertices which must be traversed in order to travel from one vertex to another when paths which backtrack, detour, or loop are excluded from consideration. It is therefore equal to the maximum of all values in the graph distance matrix. The above random graphs on 10 vertices have diameters 3, 4, 5, and 7, respectively.\nA disconnected graph has infinite diameter.",
  "Polycube": "Three-dimensional generalization of the polyominoes to n dimensions. The number of polycubes N(n) composed of n cubes are 1, 1, 2, 8, 29, 166, 1023, ...

  "Graph Distance": "The distance d(u, v) between two vertices u and v of a finite graph is the minimum length of the paths connecting them (i.e., the length of a graph geodesic). If no such path exists (i.e., if the vertices lie in different connected components), then the distance is set equal to \u221e. In a grid graph the distance between two vertices is the sum of the \"vertical\" and the \"horizontal\" distances (right figure above).\nThe matrix (d_(ij)) consisting of all distances from vertex v_i to vertex v_j is known as the all-pairs shortest path matrix, or more simply, the graph distance matrix.",
  "Graph Distance Matrix": "The graph distance matrix, sometimes also called the all-pairs shortest path matrix, is the square matrix (d_(ij)) consisting of all graph distances from vertex v_i to vertex v_j.\nThe mean of all distances in a (connected) graph is known as the graph's mean distance. The maximum value of all distance matrix elements is known as the graph diameter.",
  "Graph Edge": "For an undirected graph, an unordered pair of nodes that specify a line joining these two nodes are said to form an edge. For a directed graph, the edge is an ordered pair of nodes. The terms \"arc, \" \"branch, \" \"line, \" \"link, \" and \"1-simplex\" are sometimes used instead of edge (e.g., Skiena 1990, p. 80; Harary 1994). Harary calls an edge of a graph a \"line.\"\nThe following table lists the total number of edges in all graphs of given classes on n nodes.",

  "Angle Bisector": "The (interior) bisector of an angle, also called the internal angle bisector, is the line or line segment that divides the angle into two equal parts.\nThe angle bisectors meet at the incenter I, which has trilinear coordinates 1:1:1.\nThe length t_1 of the bisector A_1 T_1 of angle A_1 in the above triangle \u0394A_1 A_2 A_3 is given by\nt_1^2 = a_2 a_3[1 - a_1^2/(a_2 + a_3)^2], where t_i congruent (A_i T_i)^_ and a_i congruent (A_j A_k)^_.",
  "Graph Embedding": "A graph embedding is a particular drawing of a graph. The above figure shows the first several circular embeddings of the cubical graph. The most commonly encountered graph embeddings are generally straight line drawings, in which all edges are drawn as straight line segments.\nWhile the underlying object is independent of the embedding, a clever choice of embedding can lead to particularly illuminating diagrams.

  "Graph Excision": "Let a tree S be a subgraph of a cubic graph G. The graph excision G\u2296S is the graph resulting from removing the tree, then merging the edges. For example, if in the Levi graph the tree formed by the 6 interior points (middle figure) is excised, the McGee graph results. Similarly, excising the Heawood graph gives the Petersen graph, and excising the generalized hexagon (i.e., the unique 12-cage graph) gives the Balaban 11-cage.\nThe reverse of excision is insertion. Both operations are used in the analysis of cages.\nThe following table gives some cubic symmetric graphs with named edge-excised graphs, illustrated above.",

Given four colors, there are two distinct ways to color a tetrahedron and four ways to color a dodecahedron, consisting of two enantiomorphous ways (Steinhaus 1999, pp. 196-198, p. 238). Given five colors, there are four ways to color an icosahedron. Given six colors, there are 30 ways to color a cube.

A graph possessing a Hamiltonian cycle is said to be a Hamiltonian graph. By convention, the singleton graph K_1 is considered to be Hamiltonian even though it does not posses a Hamiltonian cycle, while the connected graph on two nodes K_2 is not.\nThe Hamiltonian cycle is named after Sir William Rowan Hamilton, who devised a puzzle in which such a path along the polyhedron edges of an dodecahedron was sought (the Icosian game).",

  "q-Analog": "A q-analog, also called a q-extension or q-generalization, is a mathematical expression parameterized by a quantity q that generalizes a known expression and reduces to the known expression in the limit q->1^-. There are q-analogs of the factorial, binomial coefficient, derivative, integral, Fibonacci numbers, and so on. Koornwinder, Suslov, and Bustoz, have even managed some kind of q-Fourier analysis. Note that while European writers generally prefer the British spelling \"q-analogue\", American authors prefer the shorter \"q-analog\" (Andrews et al. 1999, pp. 490 and 496). To avoid this ambiguity (as well as the pitfall that there are sometimes more than just a single q-analog), the term q-extension (Andrews et al. 1999, pp. 483, 485, 487, etc.) may be preferable.\nq-analogs are based on the observation that\nlim_(q->1^-) (1 - q^\u03b1)/(1 - q) = \u03b1, and the quantity (1 - q^\u03b1)/(1 - q) is sometimes written [\u03b1]. q-analogs provided the basis for the Askey-Wilson classification of all orthogonal polynomials.\nA physical motivation for q-special functions is provided by generalizing the canonical commutation relation\nxp - px = 1, where x is a generalized coordinate and p the corresponding generalized momentum, to\nxp - qpx = 1.\nFor example, this immediately leads to the q-analog of the Hermite polynomial. q-analogs preserve (or change only slightly) the form of the governing functional equations, and therefore arise in many physical applications, such as exact models in statistical mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and many-particle systems.\nq-analogs also have a combinatorial interpretation based on the fact that one can count the elements of some set S to get the number #S. A so-called \"statistic\" f:S->Z can then be defined which is an integer-valued function on S and separates the elements of S into classes based on what value f takes on the elements. This relationship can be summarized by writing a polynomial in a new variable, usually taken as q, where the coefficient of q^n is #{s element S:f(s) = n}. Evaluating the polynomial at q = 1 then adds the coefficients together, returning the original #S.\nThe q-analog of a mathematical object is generally called the \"q-object, \" hence q-binomial coefficient, q-factorial, etc. There are generally several q-analogs if there is one, and there is sometimes even a multibasic analog with independent q_1, q_2, ....

In two dimensions, the explicit statement of the theorem is\n integral_R f(x, y) dxdy = integral_R^* f[x(u, v), y(u, v)] left bracketing bar (d(x, y))/(d(u, v)) right bracketing bar dudv\nand in three dimensions, it is\n integral_R f(x, y, z) dxdydz \n = integral_R^* f[x(u, v, w), y(u, v, w), z(u, v, w)] left bracketing bar (d(x, y, z))/(d(u, v, w)) right bracketing bar dudvdw, where R = f(R^*) is the image of the original region R^*, left bracketing bar (d(x, y, z))/(d(u, v, w)) right bracketing bar \nis the Jacobian, and f is a global orientation-preserving diffeomorphism of R and R^* (which are open subsets of R^n).\nThe change of variables theorem is a simple consequence of the curl theorem and a little de Rham cohomology. The generalization to n dimensions requires no additional assumptions other than the regularity conditions on the boundary.",
  "Chaos Game": "An algorithm originally described by Barnsley in 1988. Pick a point at random inside a regular n-gon. Then draw the next point a fraction r of the distance between it and a polygon vertex picked at random. Continue the process (after throwing out the first few points). The result of this \"chaos game\" is sometimes, but not always, a fractal. The results of the chaos game are shown above for several values of (n, r).\nThe above plots show the chaos game for 10000 points in the regular 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-gons with r = 1/2. The case (n, r) = (4, 1/2) gives the interior of a square with all points visited with equal probability.",
  "Characteristic Function": "Given a subset A of a larger set, the characteristic function \u03c7_A, sometimes also called the indicator function, is the function defined to be identically one on A, and is zero elsewhere.

A characteristic function is a special case of a simple function.",
  "Riffle Shuffle": "A riffle shuffle, also called the Faro shuffle, is a shuffle in which a deck of 2n cards is divided into two halves. The top half of the deck is placed in the left hand, and cards are then alternatively interleaved from the left and right hands (an in-shuffle) or from the right and left hands (an out-shuffle). Using an in-shuffle, a deck originally arranged as 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 would become 5 1 6 2 7 3 8 4. Using an out-shuffle, the deck order would become 1 5 2 6 3 7 4 8. Riffle shuffles are used in card tricks (Marlo 1958ab, Adler 1973), and also in the theory of parallel processing .",

It builds a tower of logarithmic, exponential, and algebraic extensions. The case of algebraic extensions is quite complicated and is therefore not completely implemented in any computer algebra system.

  "Chromatic Polynomial": "The chromatic polynomial \u03c0_G(z) of an undirected graph G, also denoted C(G;z) and P(G, x), is a polynomial which encodes the number of distinct ways to color the vertices of G (where colorings are counted as distinct even if they differ only by permutation of colors). For a graph G on n vertices that can be colored in k_0 = 0 ways with no colors, k_1 way with one color, ..., and k_n ways with n colors, the chromatic polynomial of G is defined as the unique Lagrange interpolating polynomial of degree n through the n + 1 points (0, k_0), (1, k_1), ..., (n, k_n). Evaluating the chromatic polynomial in variables z at the points z = 1, 2, ..., n then recovers the numbers of 1-, 2-, ..., and n-colorings. In fact, evaluating \u03c0_G(z) at integers k>n still gives the numbers of k-colorings.\nThe chromatic number of a graph gives the smallest number of colors with which a graph can be colored, which is therefore the smallest positive integer z such that \u03c0_G(z)>0.\nFor example, the cubical graph Q_3 has 1-, 2-, ... k-coloring counts of 0, 2, 114, 2652, 29660, 198030, 932862, 3440024, ...

Precomputed chromatic polynomials for many named graphs can be obtained using GraphData[graph, ChromaticPolynomial][z].\nThe chromatic polynomial is multiplicative over graph components, so for a graph G having connected components G_1, G_2, ..., the chromatic polynomial of G itself is given by\n\u03c0_G = \u03c0_(G_1) \u03c0_(G_2) ....\nThe chromatic polynomial for a forest on n vertices, m edges, and with c connected components is given by\n\u03c0 = (-1)^(n - c) x^c (1 - x)^m .\nFor a graph with vertex count n and c connected components, the chromatic polynomial \u03c0(x) is related to the rank polynomial R(x, y) and Tutte polynomial T(x, y) by\n\u03c0(x) | = | x^n R(-x^(-1), -1)\n | = | (-1)^(n - c) x^c T(1 - x, 0)\n(extending Biggs 1993, p. 106). The chromatic polynomial of a planar graph G is related to the flow polynomial C_G^*(u) of its dual graph G^* by\n\u03c0_G(x) = xC_(G^*)^*(x).\nChromatic polynomials are not diagnostic for graph isomorphism, i.e., two nonisomorphic graphs may share the same chromatic polynomial. A graph that is determined by its chromatic polynomial is said to be a chromatically unique graph; nonisomorphic graphs sharing the same chromatic polynomial are said to be chromatically equivalent.\nThe following table summarizes the chromatic polynomials for some simple graphs.

  "Kaprekar Routine": "The Kaprekar routine is an algorithm discovered in 1949 by D. R. Kaprekar for 4-digit numbers, but which can be generalized to k-digit numbers. To apply the Kaprekar routine to a number n, arrange the digits in descending (n') and ascending (n'') order. Now compute K(n) congruent n' - n'' (discarding any initial 0s) and iterate, where K(n) is sometimes called the Kaprekar function. The algorithm reaches 0 (a degenerate case), a constant, or a cycle, depending on the number of digits in k and the value of n. The list of values is sometimes called a Kaprekar sequence, and the result K(n) is sometimes called a Kaprekar number, though this nomenclature should be deprecated because of confusing with the distinct sort of Kaprekar number.\nIn base-10, the numbers n for which K(n) = n are given by 495, 6174, 549945, 631764, ...

If the first rule pattern does not occur, the string is scanned from left to right for the first occurrence of the second rule pattern. If the pattern is found, the rule is applied and processing advances to the next step, and so on. If none of the rule patterns match at some step, the string repeats indefinitely for all subsequent steps. For example, consider the single rule A->B and the initial string ABA, illustrated above. The first step yields BBA, the second step yields BBB, and from there on the system repeats since there are no more matches of the pattern rule.\nA more interesting sequential substitution system is illustrated above. This system has two rules (ABA->AAB, A->ABA) and the initial condition BABA. It builds increasingly long runs of sequential As followed by sequential Bs by temporarily taking away one A before adding two more at the last step of each cycle.\nIn systems with two or more rules, it is possible for some parts of a string to never be replaced as a result of another substitution always occurring first in a left-to-right scan. For example, consider the rules (AB->BA, B->AB) and the initial string ABAB. The first step yields BAAB by replacing the first AB. The second step yields ABAAB by replacing the first B. The third step yields BAAAB by replacing the first AB, and so on. This sequential substitution system will never replace the rightmost AB because it will always be preceded by either B or AB. As a result, it builds ever longer trailing strings of As.",
  "Lattice": "An algebra \u2329L;\u22c0, \u22c1\u232a is called a lattice if L is a nonempty set, \u22c0 and \u22c1 are binary operations on L, both \u22c0 and \u22c1 are idempotent, commutative, and associative, and they satisfy the absorption law. The study of lattices is called lattice theory.\nNote that this type of lattice is distinct from the regular array of points known as a point lattice (or informally as a mesh or grid).

The multiplicand is placed along the top of the lattice so that each digit is the header for one column of cells (the most significant digit is put at the left). The multiplier is placed along the right side of the lattice so that each digit is a (trailing) header for one row of cells (the most significant digit is put at the top).

Next, draw lines perpendicular to the side BC through each of Q_(A, BC) and Q_(A, CB). These points cross the sides AB and AC at Q_(AB) and Q_(AC), respectively, resulting in an inscribed square Q_(A, BC) Q_(A, CB) Q_(AB) Q_(AC).

The middle and right figures then seem to demonstrate that the same pieces can give rise to two different polygons having area 5\u00d713 = 65 and 2(5\u00d76) + 3 = 63, respectively.

Then the symmedian point of \u0394A' B' C' is again K.\nThe tangents to the circumcircle of a triangle at two of its vertices meet on the symmedian from the third vertex. The Gergonne point of a triangle is the symmedian point of its contact triangle. The symmedian point of a triangle is the triangle centroid of its pedal triangle.

After these values are processed, the resulting set of numeric outputs is used to construct the polynomial quotient and the polynomial remainder.",
  "Multichoose": "The number of multisets of length k on n symbols is sometimes termed \"n multichoose k, \" denoted ((n\nk)) by analogy with the binomial coefficient (n\nk). n multichoose k is given by the simple formula\n((n\nk)) = (n + k - 1\nk) = (n - 1, k)!, where (n - 1, k)! is a multinomial coefficient. For example, 3 multichoose 2 is given by 6, since the possible multisets of length 2 on three elements {a, b, c} are {a, a}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, b}, {b, c}, and {c, c}.",

For example, consider the \u03bd = 1 tag system shown in the illustration above, in which black represents 1 and white represents 0.

West (2000, p. xiv) recommends avoiding the term altogether on the grounds of this ambiguity.\nSome references require that multigraphs possess no graph loops, some explicitly allow them (Hartsfield and Ringel 1994, p. 7; Cormen et al. 2001, p. 89), and yet others do not include any explicit allowance or disallowance. Worse still, Tutte uses the term \"multigraph\" to mean a graph containing either loops or multiple edges.",

  "Total Variation": "Given a complex measure \u03bc, there exists a positive measure denoted left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar which measures the total variation of \u03bc, also sometimes called simply \"total variation.\" In particular, left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar (E) on a subset E is the largest sum of \"variations\" for any subdivision of E. Roughly speaking, a total variation measure is an infinitesimal version of the absolute value.\nMore precisely, left bracketing bar \u03bc right bracketing bar (E) = sup sum_i left bracketing bar \u03bc(E_i) right bracketing bar \nwhere the supremum is taken over all partitions union E_i of E into measurable subsets E_i.",
  "Epsilon-Delta Definition": "An epsilon-delta definition is a mathematical definition in which a statement on a real function of one variable f having, for example, the form \"for all neighborhoods U of y_0 there is a neighborhood V of x_0 such that, whenever x element V, then f(x) element U\" is rephrased as \"for all \u03f5>0 there is \u03b4>0 such that, whenever 0< left bracketing bar x - x_0 right bracketing bar <\u03b4, then left bracketing bar f(x) - y_0 right bracketing bar <\u03f5.\" These two statements are equivalent formulations of the definition of the limit (lim_(x->x_0) f(x) = y_0). In the second one, the neighborhood U is replaced by the open interval (y_0 - \u03f5, y_0 + \u03f5), and the neighborhood V by the open interval (x_0 - \u03b4, x_0 + \u03b4). For a function of n variables, the absolute value would be replaced by the norm left double bracketing bar \u00b7 right double bracketing bar of R^n, and the open intervals by the open balls B(y_0, \u03f5) and B(x_0, \u03b4) respectively.\nThis does not affect the meaning of the statement, since every neighborhood of a given point contains an open ball centered at that point. Hence requiring that, for any \u03f5>0, f(x) element B(y_0, \u03f5) for suitable values of x, ensures that for suitable values of x, f(x) element U for any neighborhood U of y_0. These suitable values of x are, according to both versions of the definition, those belonging to a suitable neighborhood (an open ball in the second one).\nBoth statements express the fact that for all x which lie close enough to x_0, f(x) lies as close to y_0 as desired. In the second formulation this condition is entirely expressed in terms of numbers: \u03f5 and \u03b4 are distances that measures the \"closeness.\" This facilitates the task of proving limits since the fundamental formulas are actually shown by constructing, for every \u03f5, a \u03b4 with the required property.",

The illusion is also known as the false spiral, or by its original name, the twisted cord illusion. While the image appears to be a spiral formed by a rope containing twisted strands of two different colors, it actually consists of concentric circles of twisted cords.\nThe visual distortion is produced by combining a regular line pattern (the circles) with misaligned parts (the differently colored strands).

The fundamental theorem of arithmetic is a corollary of the first of Euclid's theorems.\nFor rings more general than the complex polynomials C[x], there does not necessarily exist a unique factorization.

These two models are examples of discrete percolation theory, an umbrella term used to describe any percolation model which takes place on a regular point lattice or any other discrete set, and while they're most certainly the most-studied of the discrete models, others such as AB percolation and mixed percolation do exist and are reasonably well-studied in their own right.",

  "Galton Board": "The Galton board, also known as a quincunx or bean machine, is a device for statistical experiments named after English scientist Sir Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly spaced nails (or pegs) driven into its upper half, where the nails are arranged in staggered order, and a lower half divided into a number of evenly-spaced rectangular slots. The front of the device is covered with a glass cover to allow viewing of both nails and slots. In the middle of the upper edge, there is a funnel into which balls can be poured, where the diameter of the balls must be much smaller than the distance between the nails. The funnel is located precisely above the central nail of the second row so that each ball, if perfectly centered, would fall vertically and directly onto the uppermost point of this nail's surface. The figure above shows a variant of the board in which only the nails that can potentially be hit by a ball dropped from the funnel are included, leading to a triangular array instead of a rectangular one.\nEach time a ball hits one of the nails, it can bounce right (or left) with some probability p (and q = 1 - p). For symmetrically placed nails, balls will bounce left or right with equal probability, so p = q = 1/2. If the rows are numbered from 0 to N - 1, the path of each falling ball is a Bernoulli trial consisting of N steps. Each ball crosses the bottom row hitting the nth peg from the left (where 0<=n<=N - 1) iff it has taken exactly n right turns, which occurs with probability\nP_p(n|N) = (N\nn) p^n q^(N - n) .\nThis process therefore gives rise to a binomial distribution of in the heights of heaps of balls in the lower slots.\nIf the number of balls is sufficiently large and p = q = 1/2, then according to the weak law of large numbers, the distribution of the heights of the ball heaps will approximate a normal distribution.\nSome care is needed to obtain these idealized results, however, as the actual distribution of balls depends on physical properties of the setup, including the elasticity of the balls (as characterized by their coefficient of restitution), the radius of the nails, and the offsets of the balls over the funnel's opening when they are dropped.",

  "Generalized Mobile Automaton": "A generalized mobile automaton is a generalization of the mobile automaton in which the automaton may have more than one active cell. Generalized mobile automata allow for more change in a single update, so interesting behavior can develop more rapidly. Like cellular automata, the generalized mobile automata can involve parallel computing. During an updating event, every active cell is updated based on the value of that cell and its neighbors. The update determines the new color for the active cell, and specifies which if any of it and its neighbors become active cells. A cell becomes active if any of the previous step's events determined that it should become active. An example is shown above.",

The ratios of alternate Fibonacci numbers are given by the convergents to \u03d5^(-2), where \u03d5 is the golden ratio, and are said to measure the fraction of a turn between successive leaves on the stalk of a plant: 1/2 for elm and linden, 1/3 for beech and hazel, 2/5 for oak and apple, 3/8 for poplar and rose, 5/13 for willow and almond, etc. (Coxeter 1969, Ball and Coxeter 1987). A similar phenomenon occurs for daisies, pineapples, pinecones, cauliflowers, and so on.\nLilies, irises, and the trillium have three petals; columbines, buttercups, larkspur, and wild rose have five petals; delphiniums, bloodroot, and cosmos have eight petals; corn marigolds have 13 petals; asters have 21 petals; and daisies have 34, 55, or 89 petals--all Fibonacci numbers.",
